          Hello Professor!
          I heard you're working on a new mission, called..mm..par..parker..
        </p>
        <p id="text3"> Yeah I heard you guys are exploring the sun! But how is that important anyway?</p>
        <p id="text5"> No I haven't, what does it mean?</p>
        <p id="text7"> But what does it have to do with us here on Earth?</p>
        <p id="text9"> Wow! This is concerning</p>
        <p id="text11"> So they technically mess with the magnetic field of the earth. But how does this cause power
          outages?</p>
        <p id="text13"> Seems very dangerous</p>
        <p id="text15">What else?</p>
        <p id="text17"> Wow! This is very dangerous. What are you going to do about it? And what is the purpose of the
          parker solar probe mission?</p>
        <p id="text19">And what is the scientific purpose?</p>
        <p id="text21">This is so impressive!</p>
        <p id="text23">I'd love to know more about this parker solar probe mission.</p>

          Hi! Well it is called Parker Solar Probe
        </p>
        <p id="text4"> Nice question!
          Have you ever heard about the solar wind?
        </p>
        <p id="text6"> The solar wind is created by the outward expansion of plasma (a collection of charged particles)
          from the Sun's corona (outermost atmosphere). This plasma is continually heated to the point that the Sun's
          gravity can't hold it down. It then travels along the Sun's magnetic field lines that extend radially outward.
        </p>
        <p id="text8"> Take for example an event that occurred on march 14, 1989. At 2:45 power was cut off to six
          million people living in eastern Canada for 9 hours. This blackout was caused by an an explosive event on the
          sun- coronal mass ejection- this particular event blasted billions of tons of solar wind directly at the
          earth. Inducing huge electrical charges, this electrical activity can damage our power distribution systems.
        </p>
        <p id="text10">As these charged particles rain into the atmosphere and above the poles, they release tremendous
          amounts of energy as they react with the gases on earth atmosphere.</p>
        <p id="text12">When the magnetic field is pushed and pulled by this onslaught of solar plasma, it creates huge
          power fluctuations that can affect power lines, overloading and damaging power transformers, tripping circuit
          breakers, and causing anything from flickering lights to widespread and potentially dangerous power outages.
        </p>
        <p id="text14">Solar winds also interfere with television and telephone signals, airplane and ship navigation.
          And they can cause pipelines to corrode faster than normal.</p>
        <p id="text16">And what about the astronauts working in space, they could be in great danger if they caught
          unaware by a solar storm.</p>
        <p id="text18">We are sending the parker solar probe to the sun to learn more about the physics of how the solar
          wind is being accelerated at the surface of the sun and it's corona, so that we can predict what the solar
          wind is going to be when it gets to Earth. And that is sort of the practical purpose.</p>
        <p id="text20">The scientific purpose is that we want to know how the stars work, as this is the only star we
          can go to.</p>
        <p id="text22">I know. And the details of the trip might as well impress you, we're getting closer to the sun
          than any other mission ever done!</p>
        <p id="text24">Sure! Let's play a little game and you will see everything by yourself.</p>

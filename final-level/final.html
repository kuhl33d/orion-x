    <span>So you see. The probe was built and extensively tested to withstand the intense temperatures and radiation in
        the
        corona. With this careful preparation, the Parker Solar Probe is designed to last for seven years and make 24
        separate passes through the corona, flying by Venus to leverage its gravity and get closer to the Sun as the
        mission
        progresses.</span> <span>By doing so, the probe has helped us measure the electric and magnetic fields in the
        solar corona,
        take
        images of the corona to reconstruct its three-dimensional structure, and study very high-energy
        particles.</span>

    <span>And now, we can avoid the catastrophic events that happened before from happening all over again by predicting
        the
        approximate time and place of future incidents and do what is necessary.</span>

    <span>We can conclude that observations from heliophysics missions benefit humans on the ground by making critical
        contributions to our ability to forecast major space-weather events that impact life and technology on
        Earth.</span>
